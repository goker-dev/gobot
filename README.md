*It's a Monte Carlo Locatization Similator with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOBOT is a basic Monte Carlo Localization Simulator. 
It uses particle filters to generate the probability distribution of possible 
locations. It has a UI and controls feature to test different probabilities. 

I developed this as my homework for **Probabilistic Robotic** course of M.Sc. 
Programme in Computer Engineering in Yildiz Technical University. http://www.bologna.yildiz.edu.tr/index.php?r=course/view&id=6900&aid=3

Usage
-----

**Robot**: Robot is blue and has an triangle shape. You can move it on the map 
with keyboard arrow buttons. And space key to measure sensors. Robot calculates probability distribution 
of possible locations after each measurement.

**Kidnapped Robot Problem**: It is to simulate a situation where the robot 
in operation is carried to an arbitrary location.
